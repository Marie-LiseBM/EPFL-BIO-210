The simplest form of slicing just works like the access by index, but replacing the index in one or more dimensions with 2 indices, separated by \":\". For instance, the syntax x[2:4, 3:9] returns the values with index 2 to 4 (4 excluded) along the first axis, and from 3 to 9 (9 excluded) along the second axis. You can optionally define a **skip value**: the syntax x[2:9:2] will select only every second element between 2 and 9. It is often useful to leave one or more values empty. x[:4] means \"from the start up to 4\", while x[3:] means \"from 3 up to the end\". x[:, 3] would return the full column 3. Tip: indices also work backwards, meaning that the last element can also be retrieved with the index -1, the second last with -2, etc."
